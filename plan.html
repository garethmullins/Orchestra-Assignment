<h1>CP1406 - 2016 Group Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Project Team 2</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong> John Gibson, Gareth Mullins, Steve Pons, Richard Turner</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The main goals of this site are to attract people to concerts, especially a younger audience;  to attract benefactors and sponsors to donate funds and other support; influence musicians and conductors to join the orchestra; and to transform the initial visual appearance of the Barrier Reef Orchestra, to one more fitting the current standing the orchestra has in the musical community.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Success of the site can be evaluated by an increase in support for the orchestra and to attract people to concerts. This will be measured according to several factors as outlined below</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased attendance at concerts</li>
<li>Increased ticket sales via the new website.</li>
<ul>
<li>As part of the success evaluation we need to link from our site to the Civic Theatre ticket sales. In order for the orchestra to evaluate the demographic for ticket sales, a short survey should be in the transition from our link to the ticket sales. Questions to be asked should be age of people buying tickets and what City/ Town they are from.</li>
</ul>
<li>Increase in submission of contact forms from prospective supporters via new website</li>
<li>Increase in submission of contact forms from prospective members via new website </li>
<li>Increase in donations to the orchestra via the new website</li>
<li>Increase in enquiries from musicians and conductors wishing to participate with the orchestra.</li>


</ul>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The website should appeal to the wider community but have a <em>focus on attracting a younger audience</em>. The composition of the site needs to be designed with an intuitive,'edgy' feel using modern themes and graphical links, while at the same time, having a depth of content that can be easily accessed by those who have a genuine interest in learning more about the orchestra. It must be remembered that, although the desire to attract a younger audience to the orchestra is one of the main goals for this site, the current audience shouldn't be made to feel alienated from it.</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The redesigned Barrier Reef Orchestra website should contain navigation and content pages as listed below:</p>
<ul>
    <li><h3>Home Page</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Main navigation page with links to main navigation subpages.</li>
